To start the simulation start the Network Server, the Join Server and the Application Server before starting the End Device.

The End Device will automatically perform the join procedure to the LoRaWAN virtual network, then it will be able to send simple text messages to the Application Server.

Using Wireshark as a packet intercepter, you will be able to simulate various types of attacks included in the "Attacks" folder.

When the script asks for intercepted packet to be manually inserted, please provide only the data payload of the UDP packets.
